# configger-rs

This repo is very much WIP lol.

The goal of this library is to be a building block for building descriptive and flexible
configuration that can be used in multiple contexts.  One piece I want to very much lean
into is configuration as code.  I also want to make it easy to define sane defaults.

So much configuration needs to live in multiple locations.  Configger should try and solve
this by having a flexible definition language that can generate any config needed.

This is a bit greenfield for me as well, but, I think a flexible data definition language,
combined with a flexible plugin system could potentially open the door for this.

## Data definition language:

Ideally this should be a flexible graph definition of types/definitions you'd want to use for
how you configure your types.

E.g. This could be an example data definition for a database:
```
Schema: {name: String, desc: String: models: []Model}
Model:  {name: String, .. fields: []Field}
Field:  {name: String, type: String?, ..}
```

The data definition language should be flexible enough to be able to extend any of the types
listed here to have more information.  An example could be a plugin wanting to specify an
override of a field to make it nullable could write a NullableField that _extends_ Field.

## Plugins

Plugins should be thought of as the "sinks" for the data defined language.  They can list
a set of dependencies they have (e.g. Schema, Model, Field) and will be given types to
generate code (or whatever) using the dependencies as a base. (Note a part of this might be
trying to get better codegen tools if needed).  Plugins can also write validation to ensure
that the configuration is valid (e.g. if someone deleted a database column).

Plugins will be linked to a set of "Data" they will expect.  This set of data might be
a subset of the total "data" view we'll have from configuration.  We may need to do some
generic tomfoolery, or we might be able to get away with generating converters when passing
the data to the plugins.

## The "Schema"

To actually use a set of data definitions and plugins, the user will create a "Schema" of
their configuration.  So a user might say "I want be able to define models that goes into
a sql database, and can be exposed via GraphQL, JSON and Protobuf", which could look
something like this:

```
builder = configger::new!(ModelSQLDatabase, ModelGraphQL, ModelProto, ModelJSON)
```

Which would generate a new schema that could be build.

## Using the schema

The schema should be programatically used by building it out.

```
let mut builder = configger::new!(ModelSQLDatabase, ModelGraphQL, ModelProto, ModelJSON);

let mut schema = builder.new_schema("default")
schema.no_protobuf();

let mut users = schema.new_model("users").set_partitioned();

users.int_field("id").primary();
users.str_field("name").max_size(100);
...

builder.build()
```

Ideally a user can also implement "sane default" functions.  So a company that uses
snowflakes internally could write a function:

```
users
    .snowflake_field("id")
    .autogenerate() // Automatically calls into our own snowflake service
```

And it should be very easy to do that.  It will need to be supported in the plugins,
so the plugin API needs to be super clean & easy to add new use cases (and testable)

### Alternate schema options

We can also generate other ways to define the schemas.  Using struct definitions
could be a possible way to define structured data. E.g.
```
#[configger(ip="...")]
struct CoreDB {
    #[configger(model)]
    user: User

    #[configger(model)]
    sessions: Session
}
#[configger(table="users")]
struct User {
    #[configger(autogenerated))]
    id: SnowFlake,
    name: String,
    #[configger(max_value=100))]
    age: u8,

    // Flatten this
    #[configger(flatten))]
    creation_fields: CreationFields,
}

struct CreationFields {
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    deleted_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

This configuration option doesn't have to be an either-or scenario, as long as the apis
are flexible enough, both config options would work.

## Use cases

Use cases I'd like to help solve:

- Model definition:
    - Protobuf definitions
    - Database schemas
    - Sane validation
    - GraphQL exposure
    - Privacy (would be harder to do)


- Event/Logging definition:
    - Protobuf definitions
    - "Which sinks should this go to?"
    - Sane validation


- Service definition
    - GCP/AWS/etc
    - Kubernetes definition
    - Local/Staging/Production config
    - Autoscaling policies


- Configuration rollout
    - Feature flags
    - Percent rollouts
    - Rollout values
    - min/max values
    - enforce values must be increasing (unless forced)

## Thoughts

- Mostly thinking of plugins doing codegen, but, could they be macros for rust code?
- How will extensions to the API work?  Is there much to the "core" here?  Or will most of the work be the data & plugins?
- Will there be a set of "core" functionality, how can we make building that seamless.
- Is the macro engine in rust strong enough to handle merging the types together.
- Can we setup snapshot tests in rust?
